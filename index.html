            I am currently a third year student at the University of Iowa studying Business Analytics and Information Systems. At the University of Iowa, I am also involved in the Hawkeye Marching Band and Iowa Pep Band. Being involved in these groups has given me the opportunity to perform at many exciting athletic events in Iowa City and around the country.

        Growing up in Iowa, I have been an avid fan of the Iowa Hawkeyes from a young age. I have always loved sporting the black and gold to watch the Hawkeyes play. As a kid, my bedroom was decorated from floor to ceiling in Iowa Hawkeye decor.
